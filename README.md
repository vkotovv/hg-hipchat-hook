Based on [git-hipchat-hook](https://github.com/eirc/git-hipchat-hook) by *eirc*.

## Installation

Clone this repository somewhere in your Mercurial repository host server.

Go to the `.hg/hgrc` in a repository you want to setup the hooks for and add a `changegroup` hook based on `hipchat_changegroup.sh` and make sure it is executable:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

HIPCHAT_SCRIPT="/path/to/hipchat-cli"

```

And you're done!
